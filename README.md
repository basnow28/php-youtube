# How to run the project

Before starting the project, make sure that the mysql server is running, you have docker and composer installed.

To install all the project dependencies, use: 'composer install' command. 

Once that is done, from the project folder run 'docker-compose up -d'.
You can then access the main project under localhost:8030.
To stop the project use 'docker-compose down'
